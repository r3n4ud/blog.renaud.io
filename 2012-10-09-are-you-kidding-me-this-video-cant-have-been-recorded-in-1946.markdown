<span itemprop="description">Today, I made some experiment with avconv on videos made with some android devices and found out that the `creation_time` of a video of mine recorded back in june seems to be crippled since the value returned by ffprobe is `1946-06-26 12:30:42`! That can't be possible…</span>

Googling time
-------------

That's strange but there are only few relevant results returned by Google on that crippled timestamp. After some digging, I found out that [FFmpeg issue](https://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/ticket/1471). In fact, that's the fourth result of a Google search on `android video creation_time` but it's like always, you just need to find the good keywords.

Matter fixed
------------
The ticket's status is `closed defect: fixed`. OK but the issue tracker doesn't contain any reference to the fix.

Uh!

Compile time
------------

ATTOW, the debian package version of `libav-tools` is `0.8.xx` and a `git log --tags --simplify-by-decoration --pretty="format:%ai %d"` shows that the `0.9` tag has been bumped in the late 2011… Too bad… I'll need to compile that myself if I really wanted that `creation_date`.

Update
------

The wording of the *Compile time* is unclear at least, so:

- libav and FFmpeg has forked.

- libav is now the default on Debian GNU/Linux.

- `libavformat/mov.c` has evolved differently but FFmpeg seems to provide a fix (that must be
  verified) but that doesn't mean that the issue has not been fixed in the libav edge, only that
  I've found only clue that the issue has been adressed by the FFmpeg project.
